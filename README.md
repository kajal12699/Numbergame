 NumberGame Java

## Project Title
**NumberGame - A Java-Based Number Guessing Game**

## Project Description
**NumberGame** is a simple console-based game written in Java where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The player has 10 chances to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. After completing all the attempts, the game reveals the correct number if the player didn't guess it. Players can choose to play again after each round, and the total number of wins is displayed at the end.

This game demonstrates basic concepts in Java such as loops, user input handling, random number generation, and conditional statements.
## Project Vision
The vision of **NumberGame** is to provide an easy-to-play, fun, and educational game for Java beginners to learn basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, user input handling, and random number generation. Additionally, the project aims to be a foundation for further enhancement, such as:
- Implementing multiplayer mode.
- Adding different difficulty levels with more or fewer attempts.
- Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve user interaction.
- Saving player statistics and high scores for future play.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a simple game that can be enjoyed by anyone while also providing a learning tool for budding developers.
